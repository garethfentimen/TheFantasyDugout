The Fantasy Dugout Project

Like all good things... this project was started after a conversation in a pub which then led to a bet.

The Fantasy Dugout was started because as a group we felt the sites available for fantasy football at the time lacked depth.

We felt the points scoring system was too generous.

At the time there was no good solution to allow groups to play in a head to head league.

The player picking system based on money meant that players such as Lampard and Gerrard were bought by everybody. 

In the fantasy dugout only one lucky player could have Lampard because the players were picked in draft at the 
begining of the season and then later after the transfer madness in January.

In the fantasy dugout the scoring system is simple: 

Points awarded to goalkeepers and defenders for cleansheets.
Points deducted when conceeding goals for goalkeepers and defenders.
Points awarded to all players for goals and assists.
Points awarded to all players for appearence.
